Oh, I see. Well, I don't know much about the incident. I do feel bad for the butler...He was always such a nice man. I wasn't there when it happened though, I was here, sitting by the fire.
Okay, thank you for your time.

Hello there
Hello sir, how are you doing?::Are you the murderer?
1,4
Pretty great, it’s a lovely evening isn’t it!
Well, yes, besides the murder of the butler…speaking of which, what are your thoughts on it?
2
The butler was my favorite person at this party! I was just picking apples and enjoying my time here when I had heard the terrible news!
Oh, you were picking apples all night? Okay, thank you for talking to me. Do you have any idea who would want to hurt him though?
3
Not really, although its possible the farmer may be responsible, since he has had a competition with the Dr. for a while. Don’t stress out too much about it though, try to enjoy the rest of your night! You’re doing a great job though. I wish I was as curious and smart at your age!
Thank you, I will see you later!
100
Of course not, how can you even say that!

Hello
Hi, I heard that you and the Dr. have had some competitions recently, is there a reason why you would want to kill the butler or harm anyone in general?
1
Whoa whoa whoa. Don’t accuse me, it wasn’t me!
Okay, but can you tell me where you were at the time of the crime then?::Why did you do it!?!
2,7
Um, sure…I guess? Just know that I wasn’t anywhere near the bathroom. Didn’t even know the butler was murdered until much later!
But could you tell me exactly where?
3
It is kind of embarrassing, and I don’t really want to tell you..
I’m sorry, but this is the only way I could know positively that it wasn’t you.::TELL ME NOW!
4,6
Okay, please don’t tell anyone, but I was snooping around the Dr’s lab. I’m trying to see what he has been up to in order to be competitive against him, but I promise I didn’t harm anyone at all tonight!
Okay, thank you for telling me. Any advice on who else I should ask?
5
I’ve heard some other CEOs talking about the Miner CEO wanting to possibly purchase the animal, so you could try with him? Good job with asking people though, you’re going to solve the crime!
Thank you, I hope so.

Don't talk to me that way! Leave me alone!

I didn't do it and that's all you need to know.

Hi
Hi, I was referred to talk to you about the murder of the butler. Could you tell me a little bit about where you were tonight?
1
No. I am tired and hungry, and the party is not fun and I just want to not be here.
I’m sorry you feel that way, what happened tonight that is making you feel this way?::Calm down, there's no need for that.
2,6
Just a lot of crazy things regarding the animal that I want to purchase but now cannot.
Well, is this anger enough to make you want to hurt someone over it?::Wow you sound angry, I bet you killed the butler.
3,7
Uh, no. You are wrong.
Okay, then please explain your situation.::Talk to me then!
4,8
Ive just been sitting here devising a plan for the whole night and I have still not come up with anything concrete. Ask anyone. I’ve been sitting in this very seat all night.
Okay, thank you for talking to me. I hope your night gets a little better.
5
You, too, kid. You should try talking to the environmentalist though. Ive heard not so great things about him. Or the Dr. He could help. You’re doing a great job though. Keep it up.
Thanks!

Don't tell me what to do!

Please leave me alone, I'm trying to do research.
But I need to talk to you!

Not now, I'm busy.
But wait...

Please leave me alone, I'm doing research.
But I need to talk to you!::I've been working hard but I don't know where else to go?
1,3
What have you been working on?
I've been trying to figure out what happened to the butler, it's been a crazy night!
4
That’s one way to put it. I’ve been so busy doing research I havent had anytime to enjoy the party, and then my butler died! What is going on?!
Well, that’s what I’m trying to figure out! Do you know why anyone would have done something like this?
5
Honestly, I really don’t know. Maybe you can check the library? I know there are some books in there that talk about motives of why people do certain things. There are also some facts about people with social anxiety that could explain the behaviors of some people too. Overall, there are a lot of good reading material in there.
Okay, thanks Dr.! I’ll check it out.
